This script will install yimmp on your Ubuntu 16.04 system. 

Before running this script make sure you are on a fresh server and running as a user. Do not run this script under root!

This install script will get you 95% ready to go with yiimp. There are a few things you need to do after the main install is finished.

You must update the following files:

1. /var/web/serverconfig.php - update this file to include your public ip to access the admin panel. update with public keys from exchanges. update with other information specific to your server..
2. /etc/yiimp/keys.php - update with secrect keys from the exchanges. 

unfortunately,as yiimp doesn't support yescryptR16 algo originally i add some yescryptR16 relationed configure document to help people build yiimp pool for yenten.

After you add the missing information to those files then run:
./main.sh
./loop2.sh
./block.sh

curl -Lo install.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crombiecrunch/yiimp/master/install.sh 
bash install.sh

You will be prompted for email, FDQN, and time zone. You onkly get one shot to enter this information correctly!
